## Why? Isn't there plenty of "starter" projects?

Its true. Other Angular developers are making some [awesome starter projects](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter). Tools like the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) can easily allow you to scaffoled a project in seconds.

We decided to make our own for several reasons 

* Its a great learning experience and we suggest you try it too!   
* We wanted to start with a more bare bones implementation of Angular & Webpack
* Deployments in other starters favor a lot of popular SaSS hosting. We use services like Heroku and Amazon too, but some of our clients deploy in custom environments and need something different.



## Available Yarn Commands

* build     -- builds deploy artifact
* start:dev -- starts dev server
